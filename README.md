## Path from the academy to the IT industry
When I worked on academic projects in school, I also had a chance to join software development in a startup. The development experience taught me how programming works outside of school. In my academic studies, programming was more like assembling the system to produce the data I needed. Instead of the program itself, the data produced was more important. However, in the startup, the program itself was a product. I needed to optimize the program and ensure it was robust enough and thread-safe. I also realized that integrating different software components requires delicate communication, especially the I/O and system compatibility. After leaving school, I started my one-year substitute military service until July 2022. It was the first time when I started to learn further about Github and the mindset of being a software developer. I am still collecting and organizing what I can share on GitHub. Besides, I am also learning about container-based development, JS, and Linux system programming. Hope that I can contribute more and more to this large community.
